![Bio.](GitHub Welcome Edit.jpg)
Hi, I'm Emily, a sophomore at Lehigh University. An Oregon native, I flew out to Pennsylvania to play on the softball team and study journalism here. So far, I'm loving absolutely every minute of it. I spend most of my time with my team, but when I'm not playing catch with my [favorite group of people](http://lehighsports.com/roster.aspx?path=softball), I'm usually paging through design inspirations with a steaming cup of coffee in hand. Feel free to [follow me on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/emilypreble/) to keep up with my newest adventures.

Below, you'll find some of my latest work from various classes and outside projects. 

### Infographics


**Home Sweet Home: Where are Lehigh Undergraduates Living?**

Here, I used Canva to create a brief infographic about the makeup of Lehigh Undergraduate residency. The data from Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research demonstrated that a majority of undergrads live either in a dorm or off-campus house.

**Bottoms Up: The Top 10 Coffee Consuming Nations**

My love of coffee inspired me to take a closer look at where the USA fell in a list of the top ten coffee consuming nations. As listed by worldatlas.com, we don't even crack the top 10! Nevertheless, the data is interestingly close and divided by cups (a standard 8 ounce cup used for a baseline) of coffee a day each country drinks on average. Canva was again used to design this infographic.

**In a League of Her Own: A glimpse at the career of Dottie Kamenshek**

Softball has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Before I even knew how to swing a bat properly, I knew every word to the movie "A League of Their Own." Here is a closer look at the life of Dottie Kamenshek, a loose model for my favorite character, Dottie Hinson.

**Change in the Number of Wins and Losses for the Lehigh Softball Program per Season**

As a member of the Lehigh softball program, I thought it would be interesting to see the fluctuation of wins and losses of my team over the last 10 years. This graph depicts the wins, in blue, and the losses, in red, of the team per season. Data provided by the [NCAA](http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careersearch).
