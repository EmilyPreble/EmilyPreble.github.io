![Bio.](EmilyPreble.github.io/GitHub Welcome Edit PNG.png)
Hi, I'm Emily, a sophomore at Lehigh University. An Oregon native, I flew out to Pennsylvania to play on the softball team and study journalism here. So far, I'm loving absolutely every minute of it. I spend most of my time with my team, but when I'm not playing catch with my [favorite group of people](http://lehighsports.com/roster.aspx?path=softball), I'm usually paging through design inspirations with a steaming cup of coffee in hand. Feel free to [follow me on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/emilypreble/) to keep up with my newest adventures.

Below, you'll find some of my latest work from various classes and outside projects. 


### Comics


**Getting to Know Me with Pixton**

This comic strip illustrates a brief glimpse at my life in my visual communications class. It is my first attempt at making a graphic with the website [Pixton.](https://www.pixton.com)

### Infographics


**Bottoms Up: The Top 10 Coffee Consuming Nations**

My love of coffee inspired me to take a closer look at where the USA fell in a list of the top ten coffee consuming nations. As listed by worldatlas.com, we don't even crack the top 10! Nevertheless, the data is interestingly close and divided by cups (a standard 8 ounce cup used for a baseline) of coffee a day each country drinks on average. Canva was used to design this infographic.

**In a League of Her Own: A glimpse at the career of Dottie Kamenshek**

Softball has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Before I even knew how to swing a bat properly, I knew every word to the movie "A League of Their Own." Here is a closer look at the life of Dottie Kamenshek, a loose model for my favorite character, Dottie Hinson. Data retrieved from [Brittanica.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dorothy-Kamenshek)

### Charts


**Wins and Losses of the Lehigh Softball Program**

As a member of the Lehigh softball program, I thought it would be interesting to see the fluctuation of wins and losses of my team over the last 10 years. This graph depicts the wins, in blue, and the losses, in gray, of the team per season from 2007 to 2017. Data provided by the [NCAA](http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careersearch).

### Maps

### Interactive Visualizations



**Going all the way: A look at an athlete's chance to make it to the collegiate level**

This visualization displays the chance high school athletes have to make it to the collegiate level. The visualization first depicts each sport, separated and editable by gender, and the amount of high school participants it has. Next to it, the graphic illustrates the number of NCAA participants the respective sport has. The darker the color, the higher the percentage. Further down, you have the ability to click a bar that interests you, or select a specific sport in the sidebar to the right, and see below what percentage of NCAA athletes compete at the Division I, Division II, and Division III levels. On the next page, you can see which sport sends the most athletes to the NCAA, by gender. Data is sourced from the [NCAA](http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/estimated-probability-competing-college-athletics). This visualization was again created with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).
