### Welcome to my page!

Hi, I'm Emily, a sophomore at Lehigh University. An Oregon native, I shipped myself out to Pennsylvania to join the softball team and study journalism here. And I'm loving every minute of it. I spend most of my time with my team, but in my precious minutes alone, I'm usually paging through design inspirations with a steaming cup of coffee in hand.

Here, you'll find some of my latest work from various classes and outside projects. 

### Infographics

Here, I used Canva to create a brief infographic about the makeup of Lehigh Undergraduate residency.
